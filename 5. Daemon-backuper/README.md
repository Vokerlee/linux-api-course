# Daemon Backuper

This projects â€” daemon-backuper which enables backup of specified file/dirs
triggered by set timer.

There are 2 regimes of usage
  * Classic: backup via recursive files traversal each time.
  * Incremental: handling events generated by `inotify` Linux kernel subsystem for lower
  costs.

## Build

```
cd 5.\ Deamon-backuper
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## How to use

There 2 modes of backups: shallow copying of object (without copying info in symboling refs) and deep one:
```
./backuperd [src_folder] [dst_folder] [--shallow | --deep]
```

To control the behavior of launched daemon `backuperd_ctl` app is used. To see all possible options do
```
./backuperd_ctl --help
```

Among all options, `inotify` or `recursive` classic regimes can be chosen.
